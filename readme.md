Pwronco utilizes the full power of multiple cutting edge Open Source tools for web development.

Highlight Technologies

* .Net Standard2.1 - .Net Core 3.1
* Blazor Web Assembly (*preview*)
* PWABuilder 1.0.0
* Radzen UI
* Blazored Local Storage
* EF Core

All features readily available *Client Side* running on Blazor Web Assembly.

*Progressive Web App* - 
PWABuilders aggressive Service Worker generation allows for offline use of this application.


NOTE: 
Need to inlcude this line for local development due to Service Worker generation: 
'''
<ServiceWorkerForce>true</ServiceWorkerForce>
'''

**Sometimes the Service Worker can struggle to clear itself out inside chrome**
**If this happens to you: Clear out your data manually via the Application tab in the Chrome Dev Tools**
